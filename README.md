# Transfer-learning-in-Deep-Reinforcement-learning
In this project, I use transfer learning on cartpole (openAI) env to demonstrate the transferring of weights in Reinforcement learning and its advantages and limitations.

# Outline of this project: 
1. We train a basic cartpole using the data generated by playing "some random games"
